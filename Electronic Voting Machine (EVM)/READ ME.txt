This is a very good program, it works as Electronic Voter Machine(EVM). It allows voter
to vote for any group. 

Before running the program make sure your IDLE should have all this modules:

1. mysql.connector
2. also make sure your MySQL is already installed in your system
3. Python Interpreter with version 3.6.x. 
4. Before running the program you need to edit the database and store your voter id in 
the database. And also replace the password of your MySQL database in the script.

It accepts candidates name, group name and their symbol for voting purpose. It accepts maximum 
10 candidates name. If you want you can increase by editing the script. Each user can vote only 
once using their voter id otherwise it generates an error message in the window. It also provide a
feature to store the voting result in text file of your directory. at the end it displays the 
result of the election with the number of votes of each candidate. As I have allowed 3 voters can 
vote at a time, so please edit the script as per your convience.

It will be highly appreciable if you use the program with the refference of my website.

THANK YOU...
